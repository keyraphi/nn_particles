# nn_particles
This is a blender addon to create a web like mesh from a particle system by connecting close points with each other.

## Dependencies
The addon is very efficient and works with millions of particles if the required dependencies are installed. After installing the plugin as usual you have to install the dependencies [annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy) in the addon preferences manually. The addon will also work without this, however it will only work well with ~1000 particles.
If blender is installed to your system the dependency installation will need admin permissions. If you downloaded blender and just run it, it should work without issue.
